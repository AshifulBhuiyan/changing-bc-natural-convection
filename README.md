# changing-bc-natural-convection

Research workspace for exploring changing boundary conditions in natural convection, with related analytical and computational experiments.

## Contents

- `peristaltic-flow/`: replication work for peristaltic flow in an elliptic duct.
- `peristaltic-flow/code/nadeem-replication.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook replicating Nadeem et al. (2022) results (mixed convection with heat and mass transfer).
- `main-paper/`: draft materials for the main paper.
- `natural-convection-enclosed/`: notes or models for enclosed natural convection.
- `outputs/`: generated figures, tables, or exports.
- `website/`: project site assets.

## Quick start
Open the notebook with Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter lab
```
Then open `peristaltic-flow/code/nadeem-replication.ipynb`.

## Requirements
The notebook imports:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
